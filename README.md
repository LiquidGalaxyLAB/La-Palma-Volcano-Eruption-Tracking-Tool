## Guide for Open Source Contributors to add more languages or correct translation in a particular language.

### To Edit a particular translation
* Go to JSON file of that particular language, say hi.json in `assests/i18n folder` for Hindi.
* Translate only the data in right as in left is the "key" of the key-value pairs.
* Send a pull request and you're done.

### To Add a new language
* If you want to add a new language, say Greek, first google the Language code of the language (for greek it is el).
* Go to `assets/i18n` and add a new file, name it el.json.
* Copy the contents of en.json and paste it there so you don't have to rewrite the keys.
* Start translating it and once done, verify it's a JSON of valid format, means no comma or brackets are missing and it has all the key value pairs.
* Now go to line number #6 of each of the JSON files and add code and language name in each of the languages, you can use google translate here, for single words it's mostly correct.
* After this go to main.dart and add your language code in a similar way as done for other languages in line #11.
* Finally go to `codingapp/translate.dart` and add the following **CupertinoActionSheetAction** code similar to how it is done for other languages,
```dart
   CupertinoActionSheetAction(
            child: Text(translate('language.name.en') + " ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
                style: TextStyle(
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.normal, fontFamily: "GoogleSans")),
            onPressed: () {
              changeLocale(context, "en");
              Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop("en");
            }),
```
* Make sure to change "en" (present at three places) and flag to the language code and flag of the language you're adding.
